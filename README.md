# ResumeStackWebsite

The purpose of this repo is for developing a React app to be a GUI interface for the ResumeStack project that I did using a SQLIte db, Python, and LaTeX to generate pdf resumes.

I am also presenting this at React.Indy meetup on Thursday July 25th. 

## Talk Description

### Full Stack Resume or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love Layered Applications
This talk looks at some dinky little script I made to generate my resume for me and my struggle to make a React app to interact with this process. Observe my struggles with developing an API to interact with a database and relearning React.
